  It’s presidential debate season! The first primary debate will be held June
  26-27 in Miami, Florida, and our hub will be hosting debate watch parties
  around the greater Los Angeles area as part of Sunrise’s summer mission to
  #ChangeTheDebate. Over 100 debate watch parties are being organized by Sunrise
  hubs around the country!


  **Our watch party be on the first night of the debates - June 26th starting at
  5:30pm. There will be 5 separate watch parties happening around Los Angeles.
  The South LA watch party will be in a yoga studio at 1746 West Adams Blvd, Los
  Angeles, CA 90018.**


  Since the debate is starting around dinner time, we are making these events
  potluck style. We want to be well fed so we can pay good attention to the
  debate and participate in the fun! You can bet there’ll food, games and a
  lotta tweeting!


  Potluck food contributions may be both large or small. Anything you can bring
  is greatly appreciated! Snack foods and drinks are welcome as well. And if you
  can't bring anything at all, that's totally ok too. The most important thing
  is that you're there.  


  Here's a random list of food and drink ideas to help get the juices flowing:
  summer farro salad, eggplant parmesan, guacamole, pizza puffs, cucumber bites,
  mango salsa and chips, grilled Mexican corn (elote), mediterranean pasta
  salad, stuffed bell peppers, deviled eggs, cilantro and tomato bruschetta,
  macaroni and cheese, nachos, coleslaw, potato salad, oatmeal raisin cookies,
  fruit salad, apple pie, "spindrift" soda, sparkling water, ginger beer,
  cranberry juice.


  Over the course of the evening, we’ll be tuning in and amplifying the actions
  of Florida hubs on the ground. We’ll also be making plans for how we escalate
  and put the pressure on candidates who demonstrate during the debate that
  they’re doubling down on the same corporate-driven policies that will be a
  death sentence for our generation.


  So come on over, please invite your friends and bring some food to share!
