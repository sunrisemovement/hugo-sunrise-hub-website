SUMMARY:South LA Debate Watch Party to #ChangeTheDebate
DESCRIPTION:It’s presidential debate season! The first primary debate will be held June 26-27 in Miami, Florida, and our hub will be hosting debate watch parties around the greater Los Angeles area as part of Sunrise’s summer mission to #ChangeTheDebate. Over 100 debate watch parties are being organized by Sunrise hubs around the country!
Our watch party be on the first night of the debates - June 26th starting at 5:30pm. There will be 5 separate watch parties happening around Los Angeles. The South LA watch party will be in a yoga studio at 1746 West Adams Blvd, Los Angeles, CA 90018.
Since the debate is starting around dinner time, we are making these events potluck style. We want to be well fed so we can pay good attention to the debate and participate in the fun! You can bet there’ll food, games and a lotta tweeting!
Potluck food contributions may be both large or small. Anything you can bring is greatly appreciated! Snack foods and drinks are welcome as well. And if you can&rsquo;t bring anything at all, that&rsquo;s totally ok too. The most important thing is that you&rsquo;re there.
Here&rsquo;s a random list of food and drink ideas to help get the juices flowing: summer farro salad, eggplant parmesan, guacamole, pizza puffs, cucumber bites, mango salsa and chips, grilled Mexican corn (elote), mediterranean pasta salad, stuffed bell peppers, deviled eggs, cilantro and tomato bruschetta, macaroni and cheese, nachos, coleslaw, potato salad, oatmeal raisin cookies, fruit salad, apple pie, &ldquo;spindrift&rdquo; soda, sparkling water, ginger beer, cranberry juice.
Over the course of the evening, we’ll be tuning in and amplifying the actions of Florida hubs on the ground. We’ll also be making plans for how we escalate and put the pressure on candidates who demonstrate during the debate that they’re doubling down on the same corporate-driven policies that will be a death sentence for our generation.
So come on over, please invite your friends and bring some food to share!
